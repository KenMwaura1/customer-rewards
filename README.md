# Customer-Rewards
This is a simple script to query a postgres database for customer details and reward them with airtime
Utilizing SqlAlchemy as the ORM and the Africas Talking python SDK to send airtime. 

## Getting Started
### Points to Note 
There are 4 main scripts in this repository: `
1. `config.py` holds all the configuration related to our database. Adjust according to your setup. 
2. `database_insert.py`  is used to insert sample customer and sales transaction data into a Postgres database.
3. `customer_search.py` is used to query the database for customers based two criteria"
    Sales_Transaction dates between 12th and 19th March 2021 and value of more than KES 2500. 
   These values are arbitrary, adjust as you prefer.
4. `customer_rewards.py` utilizes the data generated by `customer_search.py`  and the africastalking python
sdk to send airtime to each customer.
 
### Prerequisites 
- Python and pip (I am currently using 3.9.2) Any version above 3.5 should work.
- An [Africas Talking account](https://account.africastalking.com/auth/register/).
    - Api Key and username from your account. Create an app and take note of the api key.
    - Additionally, you will need to request them to enable airtime access for your account. 
    Email their airtime team for further clarification
